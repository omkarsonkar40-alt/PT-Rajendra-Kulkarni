    <h2>Musical Identity</h2>
    <p>
      Pt. Rajendra Kulkarni is a distinguished Bansuri maestro whose life
      and artistry are rooted in Hindustani classical music. Over decades
      of devoted practice and contemplation, he has evolved a distinctive
      musical approach that reflects clarity of thought, emotional depth,
      and spiritual refinement.
    </p>

    <p>
      He believes that every artiste possesses a unique musical personality,
      which is a reflection of one’s inner self. This belief is evident in
      his music, which listeners often describe as sweet, meditative,
      and deeply expressive. He is also a good singer.
    </p>

    <h2>Personality & Teaching</h2>
    <p>
      Among his disciples and acquaintances, he is known as an open-hearted,
      humble, and approachable individual. Always willing to engage with
      students and seekers, he explains musical concepts with patience,
      enthusiasm, and clarity, making learning both accessible and inspiring.
    </p>

    <p>
      His teaching reflects the same values that define his music —
      sincerity, discipline, and a deep respect for tradition.
