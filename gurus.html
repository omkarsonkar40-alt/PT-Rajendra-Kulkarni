    <h2>Family & Musical Environment</h2>
    <p>
      Pt. Rajendra Kulkarni was born into a family of art lovers and connoisseurs,
      where music formed an integral part of everyday life. His mother would often
      sing melodious songs and poems during her household activities, creating a
      naturally musical environment at home.
    </p>

    <p>
      His elder sister pursued Hindustani classical vocal music under the guidance
      of a visiting guru, further enriching the musical atmosphere that surrounded
      him during his formative years.
    </p>

    <h2>First Guru — Pt. Balasaheb Kulkarni</h2>
    <p>
      His first Guru was his father, Pt. Balasaheb Kulkarni – Bedakihalkar,
      an eminent flautist and radio artist proficient in both flute and violin.
      Under his guidance, Rajendraji was introduced to the discipline,
      aesthetics, and foundational principles of classical music.
    </p>

    <p>
      Frequent visits by musicians and discussions on classical music at home
      exposed him early to the theoretical and practical dimensions of the art,
      laying a strong and authentic foundation for his future growth as a flautist.
    </p>

    <h2>Influence of Tabla Tradition</h2>
    <p>
      Late Shri Mammulal Sangawkar, a highly respected tabla maestro who had
      accompanied legends such as Ustad Amir Khan, Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan,
      Pt. Bhimsen Joshi, and Balgandharva, often stayed at the Kulkarni residence
      while travelling to Dharwad.
    </p>

    <p>
      This association provided Rajendraji with invaluable exposure to rhythmic
      intricacies and the role of tabla in instrumental performance, deepening
      his understanding of laya and accompaniment.
    </p>

    <h2>Second Guru — Pt. Narayanrao Patwardhan</h2>
    <p>
      Rajendraji later came under the guidance of Pt. Narayanrao Patwardhan,
      a distinguished vocalist and the then Vice President of the Gandharva
      Mahavidyalaya, Delhi.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through in-depth discussions and musical interactions, he gained deeper
      insights into classical music, strengthening his conceptual clarity
      and artistic maturity.
    </p>

    <h2>Continuing the Parampara</h2>
    <p>
      Continuous devoted practice, committed performances, and contemplation
      of Hindustani classical music have ensured that Rajendraji’s artistry
      remains firmly rooted in tradition while evolving with personal insight.
