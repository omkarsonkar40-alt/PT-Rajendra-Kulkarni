    <h2>Early Life & Cultural Roots</h2>
    <p>
      Pt. Rajendra Kulkarni was born in the year 1961 in the culturally vibrant
      city of Belgaum, a land known for its deep association with Hindustani
      classical music. He hails from a family deeply rooted in art and culture,
      where music was not merely practiced, but lived.
    </p>

    <p>
      His father, Shri Bhagawantarao, also known as Balasaheb Kulkarni – Bedakihalkar,
      was a respected radio artist and an accomplished flautist and violinist.
      The family atmosphere was enriched by frequent interactions with musicians
      and connoisseurs, creating a fertile ground for artistic growth.
    </p>

    <h2>Early Inclination Towards the Bansuri</h2>
    <p>
      Rajendraji developed a keen interest in the Bansuri at the tender age of six.
      Surrounded by music at home and inspired by the sounds of classical ragas,
      his connection with the flute grew naturally and deeply from early childhood.
    </p>

    <h2>Academic Excellence & Life Choices</h2>
    <p>
      Alongside his musical pursuits, he excelled academically, securing an
      impressive 90% in his twelfth standard examinations. He initially pursued
      engineering studies after gaining admission; however, a deep realization
      of his true calling led him to make a bold and conscious decision.
    </p>

    <p>
      Choosing music over engineering, he opted for a Bachelor of Science degree,
      where he stood second in the college and was honoured as the
      “Best Student of the Year.” This phase marked a defining moment where
      passion and purpose aligned.
    </p>

    <h2>Professional & Family Life</h2>
    <p>
      In 1988, he joined the State Bank of India, balancing a committed professional
      career alongside his continued dedication to classical music. This balance
      reflects discipline, perseverance, and a deep sense of responsibility.
    </p>

    <p>
      He married Manjiri in 1989, and together they have two daughters,
      Madhuwanti and Shalmali. The family continues the artistic legacy,
      with strong inclinations towards performing arts.
